=head1 NAME

Data::Default -- Small utility for getting the default value of
an argument or variable.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Data::Default ':all';

 # variables
 my ($var);

 # later...

 if (default $var, 1) {
    # stuff if the $var is undef or set to a true value
 }
 else {
    # stuff if the $var is defined and set to true
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Just a little utility for getting the default value of an argument or
parameter.  All it really does is accept an array of arguments, then
return the first argument that is defined.

This function is usually used in a subroutine to get the
default value of a parameter.  A typical usage would be in a subroutine
like this:

 sub mysub {
    my (%opts) = @_;

    if (default $opts{'some-option'}, 1) {
        # do stuff some-option was sent and was true or was not sent
    }
    else {
        # do stuff some-option was sent and was false
    }
}

You might prefer to use C<Attribute::Default> by Stephen Nelson which
provides similar functionality.
