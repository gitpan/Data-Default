Data::Default version 0.11
=========================

NAME
    Data::Default -- Small utility for getting the default value of an
    argument or variable.

SYNOPSIS
     use Data::Default ':all';

     # variables
     my ($var);

     # later...

     if (default $var, 1) {
        # stuff if the $var is undef or set to a true value
     }
     else {
        # stuff if the $var is defined and set to true
     }

DESCRIPTION
    Just a little utility for getting the default value of an argument or
    parameter. All it really does is accept an array of arguments, then
    return the first argument that is defined.

    This function is usually used in a subroutine to get the default value
    of a parameter. A typical usage would be in a subroutine like this:

     sub mysub {
        my (%opts) = @_;

        if (default $opts{'some-option'}, 1) {
            # do stuff some-option was sent and was true or was not sent
        }
        else {
            # do stuff some-option was sent and was false
        }
    }

    You might prefer to use "Attribute::Default" by Stephen Nelson which
    provides similar functionality.
